      <h1>About Us:</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our website, where compassion and innovation come together to create a brighter future for our feline friends. Our journey began with a simple act of kindness - feeding the neighborhood cats. What started as a small gesture soon grew into a deep commitment to improving the lives of these beloved creatures.</p>

      <p>Driven by our passion, we took it upon ourselves to build a shelter, providing a safe haven for homeless cats in our community. We knew that to make a lasting impact, we had to tackle the root of the issue. That's when we discovered Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR), a humane method to manage the feral cat population. Tirelessly, we worked to spay and neuter the cats, ensuring their health and preventing the cycle of overpopulation.</p>

      <p>Then came a turning point in our lives - the COVID-19 pandemic. Amidst the challenges and uncertainties, we found an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery. We embarked on a coding bootcamp, eager to expand our skill set and find new ways to address global issues.</p>

      <p>Now, armed with our newfound knowledge and fueled by our passion, we are leveraging technology to make an even greater impact. Through this app/website we are developing, we aim to tackle a world issue that affects both cats and humans alike. Our innovative solution combines the power of data, community engagement, and collaboration to create positive change on a global scale.</p>

      <p>We invite you to join us on this exciting journey. Together, we can transform the lives of cats in need and create a brighter future for all. Let's make a difference, one paw at a time.</p>
