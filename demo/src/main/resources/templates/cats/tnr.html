  <h1 class="my-3">Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR)</h1>
  <p>TNR is a humane and effective approach for managing feral and free-roaming cat populations.</p>
  <h2 class="mt-5">How does TNR work?</h2>
  <p>TNR involves trapping feral and free-roaming cats, spaying or neutering them, and then returning them to their outdoor home.</p>
  <h2 class="mt-5">Why is TNR important?</h2>
  <p>TNR is important because it helps to control the population of feral and free-roaming cats, and it also improves their quality of life. By spaying or neutering them, it reduces the number of kittens being born and helps to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>
  <h2 class="mt-5">How can I get involved?</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in getting involved with TNR, contact your local animal shelter or rescue organization to see if they offer TNR programs or if they can connect you with local TNR groups.</p>
